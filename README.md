# 🌾 Wheat-Segmenter

**Wheat-Segmenter** is a computer vision project designed to automatically segment wheat fields from **Sentinel-2 satellite imagery** using both **machine learning** and **deep learning** techniques.  
This helps researchers and farmers analyze crop health, estimate yield, and monitor growth patterns efficiently. The project aims to streamline agricultural data collection and enable **precision farming** through AI-powered image analysis.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Automatic segmentation of wheat fields from Sentinel-2 imagery  
- Support for both machine learning (e.g., Random Forest, SVM) and deep learning (e.g., U-Net, SegNet) models  
- Scalable preprocessing pipeline for satellite data (cloud masking, band selection, normalization)  
- Model evaluation using metrics such as IoU, F1-score, and pixel accuracy  
- Easy visualization of segmentation results using color masks and overlay maps

## 🧠 Tech Stack

- **Languages:** Python  
- **Libraries & Tools:**  
  - `TensorFlow` / `PyTorch` – deep learning models  
  - `scikit-learn` – traditional ML algorithms  
  - `rasterio`, `GDAL` – geospatial data handling  
  - `matplotlib`, `seaborn` – visualization  
  - `NumPy`, `Pandas` – data preprocessing and analysis
